# Building_my_own_blockchain

Welcome to **Building_my_own_blockchain**! ðŸš€  
This repository is dedicated to exploring blockchain technology by building a simple blockchain from scratch using Python.  
Itâ€™s perfect for anyone looking to understand the core concepts behind blockchains, including blocks, hashes, mining, and decentralized ledgers.

## Features

- **Basic Blockchain Implementation:** Learn how blocks are linked using hashes.
- **Proof-of-Work:** Simple mining algorithm to secure the blockchain.
- **Transaction Model:** Add and verify transactions within blocks.
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Understand how distributed agreement is achieved.
- **Extensible Design:** Easily expand with new features or integrate with front-end apps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- (Optional) pipenv or virtualenv for environment management

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ankit12212/Building_my_own_blockchain.git
   cd Building_my_own_blockchain
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Blockchain

```bash
python blockchain.py
```
_(Replace `blockchain.py` with the main file name if different)_

## Usage

- Add transactions
- Mine new blocks
- View the current blockchain
- Experiment with different consensus rules
